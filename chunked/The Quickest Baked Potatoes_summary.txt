Step 1: Introduction by Jacques Pepin
"Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I love the classic baked potato, you know, with sour cream and herbs and so forth, but very often it takes a long time to cook. So I find out a way of doing it."

Step 2: Preparing the Potatoes
"I put my oven at 4:50 here and it takes 7, 8 minutes to get there. So the first thing that I do, I put those potatoes, I just put them in the microwave oven. They were there for 7 minutes exactly. So they are basically cooked."

Step 3: Baking the Potatoes
"During that time, my oven just came to temperature. So now I put it in there for 15, 20 minutes and that's it. And this is it. My potato were in the oven 15, 20 minutes. So it's a past, baked potato."

Step 4: Serving the Baked Potato
"The way I like to serve it, is this way. I cut it in half here. It's hot on up this way. And I press it open. Press it open like that. Put a bit of salt in there, pepper, and the sour cream. Actually, my wife put sour cream and butter in there. So, but I'll put sour cream in mine. And of course, a lot of chives on top. Lock the chives in there. And this is My fast baked potato."

Step 5: Conclusion
"Quite good. Happy cooking."
