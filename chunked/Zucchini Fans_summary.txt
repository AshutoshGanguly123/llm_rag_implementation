[Step 1: Introduction]
"Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. 

[Step 2: Preparation and Explanation]
I usually do that dish with very tiny zucchini that I find at the market. I didn't find any small one here, so I took one larger one. This is for 2 people, and then you cut it this way. You know, on a bias here like this to do 2 smaller ones. And the idea there is to do a fan. So you cut that here. 1, 2, 3, at least 4 cut like this. That we're gonna put on the side this way. It's even a bit longer. Right. And something on the other one. Okay. So I just did it for 2 here, put a bit of olive oil, and I put those on top here. This one on top. I broke that one. It doesn't matter. 

[Step 3: Assembling the Dish]
And then in between, you wanna put some tomato. So you can arrange your tomato there. Okay. Here. And a small one at the end, and then garlic. You can cut the garlic even with a vegetable peeler This way to get longer, Get very thin strip of garlic that you want to put here and there. Alright. 

[Step 4: Seasoning and Final Preparation]
Salt on top of it. Remember, it takes a pair of salt. A little bit of, Herbes de Provence or Italian seasoning, about the same thing, and a fair amount of olive oil. Be generous with that here. I'll prepare that one here. That's going to go into the oven about 20 minutes, 20, 25 minutes at 400 degrees. 

[Step 5: Conclusion]
And this is it, a beautiful dish in the style of Provence, great with a piece of lamb, lamb shot or whatever. Enjoy it, and happy cooking."
