Step 1: Introduction and Preparation
"Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. This is a small, easy dessert done with guava paste, inspired by my wife, you know, Spanish background, Puerto Rican. So what I'm using here, a regular pound cake here that you can buy, You know, a small slice about not quite half an inch wide. I'm trimming it, Although you don't have to trim it. Cut it in 4. Okay. Put that here. So here we do that for like 12, and even if you trim it, don't throw that away."

Step 2: Preparing the Ingredients
"Okay. Here we are. You can do that, of course. I'm doing guava paste, but you can use other types of dry fruit. So I have the guava here. Sometimes it comes in a can. Sometimes it comes in a block like this. And of course, this is concentrated taste. So I am turning that into about half an inch thick. Yeah. You can do them smaller than that or bigger than that, and I'm doing, like, 3 pieces like this. 1, 2, 3."

Step 3: Assembling the Dessert
"Okay, then on top of this, I put a little bit of cream cheese. This is, you know, those are just whipped cream cheese. Yeah? I like the whipped cream cheese, but you can have any cream cheese you want for this. And on top of this, of course, mint, and the mint here I have in my garden a lot of mint, but it's not really a decoration. You have to eat that piece that still leaves of mint go so well with that piece of cream cheese and so. And this is it, presenting it this way. Can even put a few little pieces of mint around and So this is this for my wife, Gloria, cream cheese and guava paste, and you can serve it on a cookie, eve on pancake. I'm sure you're going to like it. Happy cooking."
