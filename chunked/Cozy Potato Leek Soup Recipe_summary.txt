1. Introduction by Jacques Pepin: "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. We make soup at home. Winter, summer, done together with cold soup, hot soup."

2. Preparation of ingredients: "I want to show you how to make a very easy one. I have a quart of chicken stock here. Of course, if you don't have a quart of chicken stock, you can use water and about tablespoon and a half, 2 tablespoons of chicken base."

3. Cooking instructions: "So I want to bring that to a boil and cook that with a leek here. Leek is great for mince soup. As you can see, that leek is a little bit damaged. It's been around in the refrigerator for a while."

4. Cleaning and chopping the leek: "So I will remove those first two things here, probably up to here. It's no good here. A bit of the end here. What you want to do is to cut it in half this way, this way, and that's when you rinse it under water."

5. Adding ingredients to the pot: "Okay. I want my stack to come to a boil. I want to put this in there. I just have to wait for that to come to a boil and boil a couple of minutes."

6. Seasoning and finishing touches: "This has been boiling for like 3, 4 minutes, and that's fine. So I'm going to add a little flake to it. And of course, those are as stand cooking, you know."

7. Final touches and serving: "And even with the flowers of the shive, which sometime I use as a decoration. That's a very elegant soup. Maybe a couple of shavings on top. And maybe those flour here, which are edible. You know?"

8. Conclusion: "And this is this, instant potato soup for a nice dinner. Happy cooking."
