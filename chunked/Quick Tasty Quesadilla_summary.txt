1. Intro and Preparation:
"Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. Quesadilla is always welcome at lunch for me, And I like to use a very large tortilla. Those are like 10 inch, 10 inch wide. And I put like a quarter of a cup here of hot salsa and on top, like half of it. That's about all I have here. And, about the same amount of cheese. I like cheddar cheese like this. Yeah. And a quarter of a cup too. I have some corn here, so why not put some corn in there, like a quarter of a cup too, and some cilantro. Here, of course, you can fill it up with a hundred of different things, you know, whatever is in your refrigerator and all that."

2. Cooking the Quesadilla:
"Couple of tablespoon of oil here. And here I would want to use a peanut type of oil, you know. Fold it there in half. And that's it. You want to brown it like 2, 3 minutes on one side. You know, it is nice and brown and you want cheese to melt. Turn it on the other side on lower heat for like about 4 or 5 minutes too."

3. Completion of Cooking:
"And that's it. So it's about 3 minutes now. So I'm gonna flip this over, as you can see. Nice and crusty. I'm gonna lower the heat here because I want the cheese to melt in the center and all that. About 3, 4 minutes. Beautiful. Cut into a wedge. That's it. Lunch. Okay. As you can see, this is it now. Nicely, beautifully brown. On the other side too. Frosty. Let it cool off a couple of minutes."

4. Serving the Quesadilla:
"And now you can see I put about 2 tablespoons of oil here. I have close to 2 tablespoons of oil left. This doesn't really absorb. Not like bread. So here it cools off a little bit. Cut it maybe into 4 ways like this. Oh. It'll be a nice lunch. All right. Quesadilla with corn, cheese, and hot salsa. Happy cooking."
