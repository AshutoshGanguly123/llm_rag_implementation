1. Introduction: 
"Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I probably make 8 or 10 different dressings for my salad. But frankly, 90% of the time what we do is have a clean salad here. We organize salt, pepper on top, olive oil, a good amount of olive oil, and a small amount of vinegar."

2. Demonstrating cutting a cork for controlling vinegar amount:
"This is my own vinegar that I do, but what I wanted to show you how to cut a cork to make a nice spot so you can control the amount of vinegar. I cut a wedge here, and I cut another wedge on the other side here. Watch out for your finger. You have to have a sharp knife here. Yeah. So I have the cork with 2 wedge here. This is what I put into my vinegar and on top of it."

3. Conclusion:
"Okay. That's nice. So here, this is a nice pour. You know, it goes like this, and you can use it too. Great way of doing it. This is our salad. Happy cooking."
