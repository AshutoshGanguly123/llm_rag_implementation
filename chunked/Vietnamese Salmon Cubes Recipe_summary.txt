1. Introduction:
"Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I love raw salmon in gravlax, in carpaccio, in ceviche. This is a variation of it, and I'm going to do little cubes like that as an hors d'oeuvre is done in minutes, and it's absolutely delicious."

2. Skinning the Salmon:
"Notice here I have a piece of the belly of the salmon. That's the best part for raw fish. Of course, as fresh as possible. That's always very important. And I will take the skin out of it here. What you do is, you cut a little bit of the corner so that you can grab the skin, and then use your knife, you know, pull out on the skin, and use your knife as a jigsaw like this, you know, flat to be able to remove that skin here."

3. Preparation of Salmon Cubes:
"So here, I am going to have a little cube of this. Okay. About that size. So I have 3, 6, 9, 10. Yeah, about 16 little cubes like this."

4. Seasoning the Salmon:
"A quarter of a teaspoon of salt in there at the most, and a quarter of a teaspoon of sugar when I cure it. Very often, I cure it with salt and sugar."

5. Making the Sauce:
"Here, but here, I'm going to do a sauce. A couple of teaspoons of sesame oil, couple of teaspoons too of oyster sauce, and I'm going to do a bit of Sherry Char too, like a teaspoon. That's about it. Roll my thing in there."

6. Coating the Salmon:
"Couple of tablespoons that I was doing over here. I will coat all of that with this."

7. Adding the Final Touches:
"Then after actually, when I put the salt in it and the sugar, you should wait 10 minutes to let it cure a little bit. Maybe a little more chives on top, a little bit of sesame seed, give a bit of crunch on top. I have, maybe, 2 teaspoons of it too, and that easy to eat."

8. Serving the Salmon Cubes:
"I use toothpick. Usually, I use a regular toothpick. Those are really fancy toothpicks that my wife has. So this has to be reused. And you do, and you go on. And this is my little way of hors d'oeuvre. Delicious, easy to do. Happy cooking."
