1. Introduction
"Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I love to do simple lunch. And I love to use canned tuna, canned sardine, canned anchovy. And there is many on the market. Try to get it usually from Spain or or or Portugal. These are very large sardines in tomato sauce."

2. Preparation of the dish
"So you put that on that nice tray. I already have lettuce at the house, so I put a little bit of lettuce around. One of the favorite dish of my wife. Right? So we put sardine leurine. I have some veering onion here. Now we're talking about, of course, sweet onion, Vidalia onion or top like that, not too strong. And that, we're gonna put it a little bit all over. I happen to have a tomato here. If I don't have it, I don't use it. But if I have it, I use it to finish our lunch. I will cut that into wedge like this. And now to put it around like this."

3. Seasoning
"Always a good dash of red wine vinegar. That goes well with it. Often, I put olive oil on top. Not in this one. There is enough sauce. You know, my garden is starting to give me some fresh herb, parsley, and all that. Cracked pepper on top of that, black pepper."

4. Conclusion
"And this is it. Simple lunch. I think it's elegant. Very good for you with a nice piece of bread. Happy cooking."
