1. Introduction:
"Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. We love chicken at our house, and very often, I cook the thigh. Sometimes the breast is thin sliced, just sauteed briefly, but the thigh for me is one of the best part."

2. Preparation of Chicken Thighs:
"I have 2 large thighs of chicken here with the skin on, and I'm gonna show you a way I'm doing it. So I put it upside down as you see here, and I cut around the bone here. I cut to expose the bone. That will help in the cooking."

3. Seasoning and Cooking Chicken Thighs:
"On top of this, I'm gonna put salt, pepper. I start it skin side down in a nonstick skillet here. No fat, Nothing in it. Let it brown 2, 3 minutes on high heat, then I will cover it and cook it about 20 minutes at low heat. So there will be enough steam coming out of the chicken because it's covered to cook the top."

4. Preparation of Spinach:
"I have bit of garlic here and some spinach. So I take the stem out of the spinach. This is 20 minute. And as you can see now, yeah, it's pretty tender. Crushed garlic each time so that remove the skin, you see."

5. Cooking Spinach:
"Now I have all the dripping in there too, and that's what we're gonna put. A little bit of garlic. I'm ready to put the spinach in there. I'm gonna put, like, a couple of tablespoon of water here just to start the steaming process, then I cover it. And that will cook in, like, 1, 2 minutes."

6. Final Plating:
"A little bit of salt in there. Pepper. That's about it for my wife and me. The spinach and the breast on top of it. And this is in. Beautiful. Chicken thigh with spinach. Great dinner for tonight."
