1. Introduction:
"Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I often make pasta at home. Any type of pasta, I love. Hand rice too. My wife had all rice."

2. Preparation of Pasta Vazool:
"So this is pasta vazool. It's called vazool, fazool with an f to pasta and fagioli. Sometimes that is pasta and beans."

3. Sauteing Ingredients:
"So pasta and beans, we start with a couple of tablespoon of good olive oil here, I'm gonna put. And then I have about 3 quarter of a cup of, pancetta, which is unsmoked bacon, really."

4. Adding Onions and Garlic:
"So we're gonna saute that a couple of minutes with onion. It's not that ample. No way they're there."

5. Adding Tomatoes and Beans:
"I have 3 clove of garlic here. Crush it. And I would say I have there probably a good tablespoon of chopped garlic."

6. Cooking Process:
"This should cook for 2, 3 minutes. You say start browning now. So I put a cup and a half of chicken stock, cup and a quarter of tomato."

7. Boiling Process:
"That has to come to a boil first. Okay. As you can see now, nice boil."

8. Cooking Pasta:
"I think my pasta is cooked now. As you can see, I cover it. I cook it covered."

9. Final Touches:
"I like to put a tablespoon or so of butter at the end here to enrich it a little bit. Couple of tablespoon of chives or parsley."

10. Finishing and Serving:
"Now it came back to a boil. Let me test a little bit for seasoning here. And put maybe a bit of pepper. And that's it. You know, a very delicious Italian specialty here. Parmesan cheese on top of it. Maybe a little extra green. And this is pasta vazole, inexpensive and delicious. Happy cooking."
