1. Introduction: 
"Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I want to show you a very easy way to cook those large shrimp. As you see, they have been deveined, and I cook them with the shell. So don't do that if you're not ready to eat with your hand. That's how we like it cooked in the shell with your hand. So those are large shrimp, and I have about a tablespoon at the most of olive oil in there."

2. Adding seasoning: 
"Tabasco. I'm gonna put a good quarter of a teaspoon of Tabasco, about a quarter of a teaspoon, a little bit of minced garlic, yeah, dry garlic, and a dash of paprika, smoked paprika. Now this would actually be very good if you do it ahead and let it marinate for a while. Oh, and of course, a little bit of salt on top of it."

3. Cooking process: 
"So what I have here is a very hot pan. Test your pan sometime, you know, with a few drops of water. You go like that, it beat like that. You can see it on top, so that's hot. So we want to put that just this way directly. That's it. And they're going to char a little bit and this will cook minute and a quarter, minute and a half on each side."

4. Finishing touches: 
"Alright. So you see they're really sealed. We do that when we go to Amelia Island in the winter. There are people who are bored there, and they have fresh shrimp coming out, and it's really, really good. Just seal like this. And here I have now put my nose on the table. We have it here. Oh, and that's olive oil on top, or maybe a bit of herb just for color, and this is it. The seared shrimp with the shell on. Enjoy it with your finger. Happy cooking."
