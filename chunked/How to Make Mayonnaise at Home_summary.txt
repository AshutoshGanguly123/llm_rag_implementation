1. Introduction:
"Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I never think that I bought mayonnaise before I came to this country. Of course, that's half a century ago or more. And now of course, I buy mayonnaise all the time to use it. But it's nice to know how to do it. Sometimes different flavor and all that. I want to show you how to do it."

2. Preparation of Ingredients:
"And here I have one egg. Break it flat like this. Open it. This is one of the best way to remove the yolk, to do it like this to make sure that you really separate all of it. I couldn't even that piece called the shallots at the end. So I have 1 egg yolk. I'm going to have about a tablespoon of mustard here, a dash of salt and pepper. And then I'm gonna put 2 teaspoon of vinegar. So this is the base of my mayonnaise that I mix here."

3. Making the Mayonnaise:
"Okay. Some time, you can put a a towel like this around so that your bowl is more secure. And then I would have about a couple and a half of, of oil in there. So here I have peanut oil. To start with, you go slowly. I mean, sometimes everything will they tell you drop by drop, it's not really drop by drop. So here, you can as you go along, you go a bit faster with the oil."

4. Final Touches and Presentation:
"So here, probably didn't take me more than a minute and a half, 2 minutes at the most to do a wonderful bowl of mayonnaise. I want to test it. Seasoning is fine, and it's not too strong. Now here very often, I like to present it in a nice way, this way. Present your mayonnaise here. Leave it like that. It looks beautiful, or you can get this the top smooth with a knife or a spatula. And then after move your knife up and up and down in a jigsaw fashion a little bit up to here and that you pick that up to put that in the middle. Or maybe a little sprig of parsley or thyme in the center. And this is fresh homemade mayonnaise. Happy cooking."
