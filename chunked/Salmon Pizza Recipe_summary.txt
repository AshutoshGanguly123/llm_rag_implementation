**Step 1: Introduction and Preparation**
"Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I like to use those breads that I find at the market like that all of these. Those are called sometimes lavage. Sometimes they are round. Sometimes they are rectangular. This one is called artisan flatbread lavage."

**Step 2: Preparing the Lavash**
"So using as a base for a pizza that I'm going to do with smoked salmon. So what you want to do first, I have a pan here with a bit of olive oil. I'll put that in there just about the right side and put it back the other side. I'm going to cut up it so it works. Okay, put that in the oven about 10 minutes. 10 minutes at like 400 degrees."

**Step 3: Preparation Continues**
"My lavash here cooked, of course, a few minutes ago. I let it cool off because I need it to be cold to be able to continue."

**Step 4: Assembling the Pizza**
"So here, I have about a cup of, whipped cream cheese. I had my, my salmon here. I have 4 ounces of salmon, which should be enough to cover the whole thing. Alright. Here, all there. And then I have red onion. And I want to cut it really, very, very thin, about half a cup. I will put in here. Some capers. Capers goes well with the and I have some olive with that, couple of different type of olive, green one, black one, and then I have cilantro here."

**Step 5: Finishing Touches**
"Maybe before the cilantro, I should put a little bit of oil on top of it. Here we are. And then my sealant on top. And here we have beautiful smoked salmon pizza. You can even cut some of it ahead. You wanna cut it? Makes it makes it a bit easier. And this is it, the smoked salmon pizza. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Happy cooking."
