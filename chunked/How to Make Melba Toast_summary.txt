1. "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. Auguste Escoffier was a very famous French chef beginning of the century. He died in 1935. But from the middle of 19th century until almost the middle of 20th century, e codified French cooking made a great deal of what we call classic French cooking now.

2. It is several recipe which I remember today, especially a couple from the Australian soprano called Melba.

3. He did the peach Melba, which is a poached pitch with a raspberry sauce and whipped cream on top and the toast Melba.

4. Melba like our toast very, very thin, and he had he developed a way of doing it.

5. With a thin slice of bread like this one, I put it in the toaster, and I'll show you what it did with it when it comes out.

6. Okay. That's about ready now. And as you can see, you have to do it right away when it's when it's hot.

7. You trim it, and I keep the trimming, of course, and you have the thin slice here.

8. Now you spring your knife right in the middle of it. That's it.

9. To do 2 toast, extremely, extremely thin. This is what the real toast melba was, and you serve it this way.

10. You can cut it in half again. I serve it like that with butter and all that, and here is the real toasted melba. Happy cooking."
