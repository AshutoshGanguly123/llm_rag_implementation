1. Intro:
"Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. Well, the most classic dessert we do in French cooking is the peche melba, the peach melba. This was invented by Escoffier, a great chef of the 19th century in the honor of the soprano, the singer from Australia, I believe, Melba.

2. Preparation:
"So he did the peach, Melba, and liked the toast, Melba as well. She liked it, her toast, extremely thin. So conventionally, or very often, it is done with cooked pear. You cook the pear, of course, in a syrup and so forth. Here I have fresh peach, and the fresh peach during, especially the white peach. Those are white peach. That's what I'm going to use there and show you very simply how to do it. So half a peach per person, and the pitch sometimes are free. Here is my half peach here, which is beautiful white peach, just ripe."

3. Ice cream preparation:
"So what I will do here is a piece of pound cake and then ice cream, vanilla ice cream. When I get ice cream, I get a package of ice cream. I often cut it into 6, 7 pieces and roll it individually in plastic wrap like this. So when I need an ice cream, I just grab it out of the freezer this way, and it's very much fresher."

4. Assembly:
"So here I have my ice cream on top. I have my 2 bowl of, of, beautiful peach here. These are going to be on top. And of course, this is with the raspberry raspberry preserve on top. That's the classic classic recipe with a few almonds, Maybe a little spring of mint for decoration."

5. Conclusion:
"This is the pejmalba in the memory of the great singer. Happy cooking."
