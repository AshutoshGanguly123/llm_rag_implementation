1. Introduction:
"Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. Today my dish is slightly different. I'm using chicken feet. I know chicken feet is not your common ingredient, but I find them at my market. And you know, many great cooking of the world, Chinese, South America. I've been to many part of the world, Thailand and Vietnam and all that. They use them, and it's very good. I have to say I clip the end of the the nail for that."

2. Cooking Process:
"I have a part of this. I'm gonna do that Chinese style that is, with a sauce that I'm going to do. Here, I have 1 tablespoon of oil, a couple of scallion to cook this. This, of course, is very, very inexpensive dish. If you never tried it, you should. So on top of this, I'm going to put some, some garlic, a good tablespoon of garlic, and about the same amount of ginger. So those chicken feet here, I cover them with water, a dash of salt, and they cook for a good hour so they are nice and tender. Make a fantastic stock."

3. Sauce Making:
"The ginger. I want to make a sauce here. And in this, I have a good quarter of a cup of my stock here and a teaspoon of chili garlic sauce. So it's very hot. A tablespoon of sesame oil, a couple of tablespoons at least, soy sauce. Bring that to a boil, and commercially, the thing is thickened with a bit of arrowroot or potato starch and all that. At that point, I'm going to thicken it with a little bit of ketchup. That should give me enough thickness to make a creamy sauce out of this."

4. Cooking the Dish:
"And of course, my feet which are cooked. As I know, I'm gonna cook them a couple of minutes to get them hot in there, and that's it."

5. Serving:
"You want to serve that at the end. Of course, we'll cover them with a fair amount of cilantro, coriander, Chinese parsley. It's all the same thing."

6. Final Presentation:
"Okay. And here it is, the chicken feet with a spicy Chinese sauce. Okay. Cilantro on top. Very inexpensive and absolutely delicious. Happy cooking."
