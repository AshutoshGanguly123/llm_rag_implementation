"Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I'm gonna show you how to make my shrimp cocktail. Very often the shrimp, you know, are just poached in water, and that's when I want to do it a bit differently. Those are large shrimps. As you can see, those are about 15 count. I kind of press on the tail like this to pull it out because sometimes I want to have the tail itself coming like this. So those are I have half a pound of shrimp here. As you can see, and the first thing that I do, I'm going to put a good dash of pepper flake, 1 cup of water, a little dash of Herbes de Provence or Italian seasoning, maybe 1, maybe 2 tablespoon of white vinegar and maybe a couple of tablespoon of onion in there. Yeah. So any old way doesn't really matter. What I want to do now is to bring that to a boil. I'll boil it for like 5 minutes, you know, so I really have taste in this. So now the sauce usually a couple of tablespoon of, maybe 2, 3 tablespoons of ketchup, a good teaspoon maybe of cherisha here, maybe a good teaspoon of of horseradish and a little dash of rice vinegar, maybe a teaspoon. I do different types of sauce for that, but that's one of the sauce that I do for shrimp cocktail or for my clam. Okay. So the shrimp shells here I've been cooking. Quite potent, strong. So I will push it. All I need is basically the liquid here. That's it. I'll put my liquid back in there and the shrimp. All I do now, I bring it to a boil. As soon as it comes to a boil, I shut it off, put it on the side to cool off. Okay. Now my shrimp are cold. They've been staying in that liquid too. So I will put a bit of that really flavorful liquid to put here, there, and like 4 shrimp parmesan. We're going to put 4 shrimp parmesan here. This way. This way. Those are large rim, of course. Whoop. The thick side inside rather. Right. You can bring that here. You can put a little pieces of basil or something if you want in the center for presentation. And this is our shrimp cocktail. Happy cooking."
