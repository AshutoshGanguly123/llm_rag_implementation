"Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I never throw bread out. You know, I do crouton, and I use crouton for soup, for many, many different type of things. Sometimes dry crouton, sometimes the way I'm going to show it to you here, one of the easy way, I have 2 tablespoon of butter and about 2 tablespoon of oil here. And you need a peanut, this is sunflower, Put that in the oven to melt like this. Okay. A couple of minutes, 400 degrees, and then I cut my crouton. I have a baguette here, and I'm going to do it in crouton about, well, not quite half an inch thick. Again, you know, when you use a knife like this, very often people are going to put the knife on top and apply pressure, and you end up like that. You have to reopen all of those slice of bread individually. Tarte here, you finish here. That's the pressure. This way. Some of them, I'm going to do maybe a bit thicker and do some crouton this way. Even when you do a tomato salad, the juice come out of it. You put crouton around, and it kind of absorbs the juice. Okay. Here it is. And I have about with 3, 6, 9, about 16, 18 to fill up a little tray like this. So I have my butter melted here. So I put the crouton in there and put them in one corner here, toss them into it, and then now those. Okay. You dip them into the butter oil, and you turn them on the other side. If you do that in a skillet, you know, doing, it will absorb probably twice as much, oil or butter than this. That's one more, too much. I'm going to eat it and put that in the oven about 10, 12 minutes or so, and this is it. You know, it goes into the oven nice and crisp. You may want to put a bit of herbes de Provence, some paprika on top, but basically, this is your basic way of doing crouton, and you can use them a lot. Happy cooking."
