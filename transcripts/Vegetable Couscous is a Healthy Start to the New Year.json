"Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. Today, I wanna show you how to make couscous, And couscous, you know, is a semolina. It's, it's wheat, regular wheat, which is granulated, And you can buy it uncooked, but usually it come precooked. So you cover it with boiling water or stock, and that's it. So it's very easy to do, but I wanna show you how to do a vegetable couscous here. And what I have, I'm gonna put a tablespoon of Okay. I have a couple of, of mushroom here. 2, 3 mushrooms, coarsely chopped, which is also going about half a cup. Cook all those vegetables for a minute or so, then I'll put tomato. I have 1 tomato cut into cube. Probably would have enough with this, but I don't want to waste it. I'll put the whole tomato in it. There's probably 1 cup of tomato. Put the vegetable. Let's say 2 2 cup lures of spinach, baby spinach. That melt do nothing. Like, a container like this is 5 ounces. I didn't even take half of it. And I think I can add my tomato. So frankly, you can have any vegetable you want. So here is the couscous here. I have a cup of couscous here. Usually, you put about the same amount of liquid in it. Since I have a little bit of that, I may put 3 quarter cup of chicken stock. Just put salt. And I want to let it cook another 3, 4 minutes because remember, when I mix the couscous in it, the boiling stock, I cover it, leave it on the side. See there's no more cooking. Alright. I think my vegetable are cooked enough here. I'll make my couscous in it. Shut the heat up. Mix the couscous, and I have 3 quarter of a cup of boiling stock here I'm going to add to it. Should we take 1? That's it. Cover it, 5 minutes. That's it. This is it. Obviously, it's a bit different this way, but So what you have to do is what you call agronet in France to fluff it. I get fluffy. Well, you can see with 1 cup, one cup of couscous, I do quite a lot. So of course this would be a great garnish for a for a roast chicken to fish. It doesn't stick at all too. So this is it. Good. And what I wanna show you, you know, what I have when I do a puree of potato, a puree of other thing, rice, pasta, sometime all this. When I have any leftover, which I often do this is what I do for lunch the day after. So let's say this is leftover. So I have a bunch of those, whoop, leftover here. I do it this way. I create a a nest here. Of course, at that point, it's a bit different because the mixture is cold here, and I put an egg in the middle of it in my lunch. On top of that, a little bit of Gruyere cheese, you know, Maybe a dash of hot sauce, few drops, or even maybe a bit of herb if I have it here. Cover it. Always cover with, with paper towel, you know, and in the microwave for a minute. Okay. I end up putting it 2 or 3 times. I put it on 1 minute. I put it on another 20 second, and then another 15, 20 seconds. So this is the way I like it here. The whites are set, and the yolk is still quite liquid as you see. This is the way I like it the way my wife like it. So I hope you make that couscous. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, and happy cooking."
