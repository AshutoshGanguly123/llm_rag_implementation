"Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. Many years ago, I was in New York at James Beard house. I was very friends with James Beard in the 60s, 70s and so forth. One time I was at his house, he was doing his famous onion sandwich. I've done it several times home because my wife loves it. So I want to show you how to do it. And those were a round sandwich. So if you have a cutter like this, you can cut it with this. Try to get it to lose the least amount of bread, and I have that, that glass. Well, it's not very cutting, but I can still cut it after with a knife just to mark it. Yeah. Okay. And so I will cut it a little bit here. Remember that you always keep the trimming, you know, to do breadcrumb. I always do breadcrumb with those creaming. You put that in the food processor and you have beautiful fresh breadcrumbs. And it is actually quite different than the bread crumbs that you buy. Because the one which is dry, you have much more bread in it. So here, I have 2 round things. We want to put mayonnaise on top of it. Generous with the mayonnaise. Once up here, again here, and the slice of onion. You could add an onion, the same size on your sandwich, a good slice, Probably a bit harder, a bit easier to do it with half onion and cut 2 thin slices like this. 1, 2. That's it. What you want to do now, add a little bit of salt on top of it. We'll get the salt, then the other slice of bread. Really glue it together. And what you want to do now is to put a bit of mayonnaise on the outside if, of course, you can prepare ahead. And finally, I think James Beard did it with parsley. In that case, I'm doing it with shives. Just dip it into shives like that. Yeah. Beautiful onion sandwich here that I can cut in half. And this is one sandwich that my wife loved. Well, James Beard sandwich gave me an idea for another sandwich. In France, we already have radish with butter and, and bread and salt on top of it. So I'm going to do a a radish sandwich at that time instead of mayonnaise. Here, I'm using butter. Okay. Sweet unsalted butter, which which is gonna use at home. Okay. And then the radish. So you can cut the radish to wrap them very thin like that, which is what I'm doing here. Okay. So I have a bunch of radish here, Very thinly sliced. I'm gonna fill up the bread with that. Here. Here. There. On top. Here. Here. Loblaw radish. Beer salt. The other bread on top. Glue it together. Then I'm gonna trim it. This one is going to be square. That's not round but doesn't really matter. Okay. And on the side, in the same way, I'm going to put a little bit of butter on the side. Okay. Here. Okay. And likewise, in that case, I'm dipping it in parsley rather than chive, but could be 1 or the other. It doesn't really matter. Here we are. My radish sandwich, that's it. The radish sandwich, the onion sandwich, great for lunch. Happy cooking."
