"Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. Years ago, we used to do spinach differently than now. We used to boil the spinach in boiling water. When they were cooked, drain them out, cool them up, press them into bowl, and they were ready to be sauteed or whatever. We don't do that anymore. We also used to remove, but those are pretty small as you can see. Those are not baby spinach, but small enough. The big one, we use to remove them by putting your hand this way and pulling out the stem like that of the big spinach, and that would be kept to do spinach puree or put into a soup. But here what we are going to do, I have half a pound of spinach here and garlic. What we do with it, I'm going to do finely, finely chopped garlic. And I like a lot of garlic. So as you can see here, I have like a tablespoon and a half of garlic, which I'm going to put into that skillet with a good tablespoon, maybe tablespoon and a half of oil. So I want to cook my garlic a little bit here, but I don't want it to burn, of course. As you see, my spinach are a bit still wet from being washed. I will start putting a bunch of spinach inside this way, right on top of the garlic. And then here, remember, this is cold. So I can grab those peanuts and turn them around. This way to put my garlic on top. So I don't burn my garlic in the bottom. Okay. Then put the rest of it here. There is enough moisture, as I say in those spinach, so they go down to basically nothing. This would be for like 2 people, 3 maybe at the most. Dash of salt, I will put it now. Dash of pepper, of course. And that's about it. The spinach are going to break down within a minute. Covering it will increase the moisture. They start breaking it down. So you can check your peanuts occasionally as you can see, they're all getting totally wilted underneath. As you can see, there is liquid in there from the spinach. I'm going to spurge a little bit and put like a couple of teaspoons of butter in there to finish it up. And now I leave it up like this to evaporate a little bit of the moisture, and that's it. I will test it. Well, good. And this is about it. I don't mind if there is a little bit of juice left over. It's good to dunk your bread into it. Okay, so this is half a pound of spinach, as you can see, with the garlic. Just enough for my wife and me for dinner. Happy cooking."
