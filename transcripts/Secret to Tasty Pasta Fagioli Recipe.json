"Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I often make pasta at home. Any type of pasta, I love. Hand rice too. My wife had all rice. So this is pasta vazool. It's called vazool, fazool with an f to pasta and fagioli. Sometimes that is pasta and beans. So pasta and beans, we start with a couple of tablespoon of good olive oil here, I'm gonna put. And then I have about 3 quarter of a cup of, pancetta, which is unsmoked bacon, really. Just cured pork like that that you can get at the market now. So we're gonna saute that a couple of minutes with onion. It's not that ample. No way they're there. Exactly. I would say a good a good cup. So maybe I put the whole onion. Just put in there. I have 3 clove of garlic here. Crush it. And I would say I have there probably a good tablespoon of chopped garlic. Toffee chop is fine. This should cook for 2, 3 minutes. You say start browning now. So I put a cup and a half of chicken stock, cup and a quarter of tomato. Tomato, diced tomato, puree of tomato, and mixture like I have here is perfectly fine. Rinse it out. Of course, salt and pepper in there. Probably, at least half a teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of ground pepper. The beans, better to drain them. So maybe I'll put some of the juice of the beans here. And this is a can of cannelloni beans. It's about about a pound, not quite. Okay. So that has to come to a boil first. Okay. As you can see now, nice boil. And this is, a good cup of, yep, a good cup of penne, which is about 4 ounces. Here it is. Continue boiling. I think my pasta is cooked now. As you can see, I cover it. I cook it covered. The reason is that if you don't cover it very often, too much liquid evaporates, and it makes it very difficult for the pasta to cook. So check it out when your pasta is cooked this one. About 20 minutes. Then I got my the beans. All of that have to come to a boil now and that's about it. I like to put a tablespoon or so of butter at the end here to enrich it a little bit. Couple of tablespoon of chives or parsley. Now it came back to a boil. Let me test a little bit for seasoning here. And put maybe a bit of pepper. And that's it. You know, a very delicious Italian specialty here. Parmesan cheese on top of it. Maybe a little extra green. And this is pasta vazole, inexpensive and delicious. Happy cooking."
