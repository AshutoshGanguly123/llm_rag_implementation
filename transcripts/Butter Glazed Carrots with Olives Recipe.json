"Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I like to cook vegetable separately from the meat. And very often, people kind of garnish a plate, but, especially with carrot, for example, I like to glaze them. And here, I have a pound of carrot, baby carrot. I could use sliced carrot or baby carrot. That would be enough, of course, for, like, 4 or 6 people. So what I do with this, I put about 3 quarter of a cup of water, a quarter of a teaspoon of salt, but a good teaspoon, teaspoon and a half of sugar to help the blazing. 2 tablespoon of butter. So this will come to a boil. Let it boil 5, 6, 7 minutes. Okay. See my carrot now, there's still quite a lot of water too. The carrots are well, they are not totally our standard, and I would like to, but this is the time now to remove the lid and continue cooking that until that water reduce, and you are left with the sugar and the butter. So now cook it open like this. Okay. So I've got you see, basically, all the juices disappeared here. Let me taste 1 to know whether it's cooked enough for me. Yeah. Here a dash of salt. No. I think the olive. I'm going to add another tablespoon of butter to glaze it a bit more. The chives. Could use the shive, of course, when you are going to serve it. That's it. This is a great garnish with a steak or a piece of chicken, even with fish. So that's about it. Very nice. I already put more herbs, and on top, I have that beautiful chervil here from the garden. A bit more chive or chervil, and that's it. Butter glazed carrot with olive. Happy cooking."
