So first, we do the sauce, and I'm going to put here about 3 tablespoons, 2 onefour of a cup of the most of mayonnaise, like a good tablespoon of sour cream. I would say 1 or 2 teaspoons of horseradish, some very fine minced onion and I would say a quarter to a quarter of a cup here. Again, this is mild onion, remember. And a good tablespoon of chopped chives. And let's add a little bit of that hot sauce here. Add a Chinese sauce or you can put Tabasco in it or, okay, let's start with this. You will test it. Salt. Mornay. And finally, my crab meat here. I have 8 ounces of crab meat here. And as you can see, with our beautiful lump of crab meat That should be served cold.
