"Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I want to show you one little thing that I do when I go home. I love ice cream, but often you buy ice cream, it is a pint. Usually, I buy quad. But you take some out, You leave it in the freezer. Then a week later, it's kind of all strange around. So what I do is this, I remove this. I cut the side of, the thing so I can unmold it, And I cut it in portion. In there, I would do 4. This and this, and that I put directly into a baguette like this, and I mold it into a nice bowl. That's it. Nothing wasted like this and are super fresh like this. So that goes into the freezer. After dinner or when, someone want an ice cream, I'll take it out take it out of the freezer 15, 20 minutes ahead, leave it in the refrigerator. But, you know, this will keep very beautifully fresh like this. I mean, I put it into a bag, but you can put it in a little piece of a classic wrap. You know? And often, I serve that with a bit of a sauce. Here, I have peach jam, so a little bit of peach jam on top. Alright. Some some nuts. In that case, here I happen to have pumpkin seed. I already have nut in my refrigerator, and maybe like now I can have a little bit of spring of mint, and here I have 3 star restaurant dessert, beautiful, control. Happy cooking."
