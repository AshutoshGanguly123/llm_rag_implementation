"Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. This is a very simple gratin of shrimp that I'm doing here. When I buy shrimp like that, those were frozen. I like to buy them if they already have the vein removed like this. So this is cut here, so you don't have to worry about cleaning it up, just remove the shell. Sometime, I cook them with the shell depending what I do, it add some flavor, but not for that particular recipe. What we want to do is to cut those. I have about a dozen shrimp here, and I want to cut them in half. So in half or in 3rd, if they are bigger, it's not very important. Put them in there on my gratin dish here. About a cup of bread I have leftover here. Nice way of using your leftover bread. Okay. That's it here. Okay. The garlic. Okay. In there, Scallion. Give me a bit of color there. It's a little bit the same mixture you do when you do snail and all that. I have a couple of mushroom here, which I have to rinse, and add them to it. Coarsely chop like this. Into this, I'm putting more parsley, 2, 3 tablespoons of parsley. And now I have 3 tablespoons of butter here. And I think I'm going to put about 2 to 3 tablespoon of oil as well, olive oil. And of course, on top of that, I need salt and pepper. And this is you can prepare that ahead. You can prepare that even in the morning and all that. It's fine. Now I want to stir the whole thing together, but can it be and, you know, you can do that with fish, with, like, diced salmon, or you can put scallop in there, or you can put calamari, and that's it. You're ready to put it into the oven, and this is it. 400 degree oven. It was there for about 18, 20 minutes, and here is my delicious gratin of shrimps. Don't forget the butter in the bottom with all of the goodie. Cut them off shrimp with bread and mushroom and all that. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Happy cooking."
