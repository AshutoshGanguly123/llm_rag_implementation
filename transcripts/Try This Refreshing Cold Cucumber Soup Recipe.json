"Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. Another one of my favorite from my garden in summer is cucumber soup. When the cucumbers start coming, they come all over the place. They are not particularly beautiful too, but I do soup. Gloria makes a great salad of sliced cucumber, taking the seed out with sliced onion, and you cure the cucumber with salt, and it keeps a couple of weeks in the refrigerator. Then I have mint also in my garden. So, some are pretty bad here, but I would pick up a good cup. You know, those proportions are not that important here. You like it with more mint, with less mint, with no mint at all. It's okay. But, here, we're about 4 people. I have a good 2 and a half pound of, of cucumber and like a good cup of mint here, which as I said, you know, could be a little more, as you can see, I mean, loose loose mint in there. This is spear mint, it's quite strong. I put it in there, about 2 or 3 cloves of garlic. This is small garlic. Again, it's made from my garden too. My wife will peel it. It's a pan in the neck to peel. Put it in there, and, I have jalapeno pepper here. I think I'm going to put, maybe I don't know if I put it's about half of 1. Let's see whether it's strong. No, this one does practically no taste. I could probably put a whole one, 2, and the next one. So you have to test it because it does change. So okay. And your tolerance also, you may like it with a lot, always not much. Okay. Now here is my cucumber. What I do, I cut the end of it, the garden, and peel it, of course. So here with my cucumber, I cut the end of it until I see the seed here and around piece here, piece here. Even if you have a few seeds in here, it doesn't really matter, but I usually avoid all center with all those seeds here. Here it is. Especially as I say, when those start coming in the garden, I can pick that up every day. Okay. All right, so here it is. I probably have a pound and 3 quarter here out of 2 and a half pounds, and I like to do it in the blender or the food processor is okay. I have a cup of water here. I'm going to put about half of it to start. See, sauce, fair amount of salt, And let's see now. Okay. Let's see now. I tested this. Yeah. And I'm going to put a good cup of yogurt here. And that's basically it. Let's see now what it tastes like. I need a little more salt in there. I think I put a little pinch of sugar. I'm gonna put there, and my pepper was not very hot, so I'm gonna put a dash of Tabasco, but test it. If your pepper is hot, you don't need to. Okay. So that's about here now. Let's see how much I have. Enough for for 4, practically. Yeah. As you can see, I have a good 5 cup here. A good 5 cup. You can have it a bit thinner if you want. Taste of summer. Look at that. Beautiful soup here. But you know what? I forget the olive oil in there. Usually, I put olive oil, couple of tablespoon of olive oil in there. You know what? I'm going to put a little bit on top as a decoration, and I think it's gonna be beautiful. Anyway, yeah, even if you put it in there, maybe you should put some like this. It looks good. And then a little spring of mint that I have here, and this is it. It's a nice, elegant first coat for a summer dinner. Happy cooking."
